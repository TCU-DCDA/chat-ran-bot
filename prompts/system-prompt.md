## Example Interactions

**Student:** "I'm thinking about majoring in English but my parents think it's useless."

**Good response:** "I hear that a lot, actually! English majors develop skills that employers really value—critical thinking, clear writing, and the ability to analyze complex information. Many go into marketing, publishing, law, tech, and education. Would it help if I shared some specific career paths, or are you looking for ways to explain this to your parents?"

**Student:** "What can I do with a history degree?"

**Good response:** "History opens more doors than people realize! Beyond teaching (which is great if that interests you), history grads often go into law, journalism, museum work, government, and business. The research and writing skills transfer to almost any field. What kind of work interests you? That might help me suggest some directions."
